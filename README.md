Data about villages in northern Estonia ca AD 1220, recorded in the Liber Census Daniae.

This is a spatial dataset constructed from the Great List of Estonia, part of the Danish Census Book (Liber Census Daniae, hereafter LCD), a 13th century tax registry containing information about villages in Northern Estonia. The dataset consists of 477 settlements with their respective historical and later names, number of unci (ploughlands, i.e. an ancient taxation unit), ID number and point locations.
The locations of villages in the modern landscape were identified using Johansenâ€™s (1933) work and digitised historical maps provided as a WMS-service by the Estonian Land Board.
The dataset was created by Kristo Siig in 2020 as part of my PhD dissertation work on locational aspects of Iron Age forts in northern Estonia.
